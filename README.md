======

This project aims to create an RPG engine for creating tactical isometric games. It will have its own RPG mechanics eventually, but the plan is to leave it flexible and clean enough to easily drop in or build out engines based on different rule sets. A good deal of the graphics foundation has been laid out as well as basic movement interaction. It uses the LibGDX game framework.
